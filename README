crossroad
=========

`crossroad` is a set of scripts implementing a command line tool to set up easily a cross-compilation environment on a GNU/Linux
distribution.
Two target environment are supported currently:

- Windows 32 bits;
- Windows 64 bits.

*Note: no difference are done between Windows platform other than 32/64 bits. This is up to you to take care of available APIs in your code.*

Usage
=====

From a command line, run::

    $ crossroad w64

This will set up a Windows 64 bits cross-compilation environment.

Your prompt will also be slightly modified (only adding information. Whatever prompt hack you may have made — like displaying information on
a git/svn/hg/whatever repository — will be untouched) to show you are in your working cross-compilation environment.
*Note: only bash is supported right now.*

You will also be moved to the root of this environment, under which a usual GNU style tree has been prepared. This includes a bin/, usr/,
etc. All necessary environment variables, like PATH or LD_LIBRARY_PATH, etc., are set for you.
Yet when you will compile your new software, you are obviously advised to use the crossroad environment prefix. For this, `crossroad`
prepared an easy to remember, ready-to-use, environment variable: $CROSSROAD_PREFIX and $HOST.

Let's imagine you want to compile GIMP or any other software with a typical GNU compilation system.
After running crossroad, go into usr/src/, where you will download GIMP source code:
$ cd usr/src/
*[get some source code]*
$ cd gimp
$ ./configure --prefix=$CROSSROAD_PREFIX --host=$HOST
$ make
$ make install

Of course this kind of compilation with prefix is not limited to autotools. It is pretty common. You see this with most Python tools:
$ ./setup.py --prefix=$CROSSROAD_PREFIX

Or cmake:
$ cmake . -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX:PATH=$CROSSROAD_PREFIX

*Note: cmake has a special logic for cross-compile and it is not just as simple as setting a target. TODO.*

and so on.

About the name
==============

The name is a hommage to "cross road blues" by Robert Johnson, which itself spawned dozens, if not hundreds, of other versions by so many
artists.
I myself always play this song (or rather a version with modified lyrics adapted to my life) in concerts.
